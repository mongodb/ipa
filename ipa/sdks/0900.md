# IPA-900: Handling Multiple Content Types in Atlas Programmatic Clients

Handling multiple content types in API responses is essential for providing
flexibility for programmatic clients. Guidance outlines best practices for
managing multiple content types for request and response bodies for Atlas
programmatic clients with a particular focus on scenarios where a 2xx HTTP
response is returned.

> [!WARNING]  
> **State:** Experimental

## Guidance

### Content Type Preference

- When an API response includes multiple content types, all OpenAPI-based
  programmatic clients **must** support `application/vnd.atlas.YYYY-MM-DD+json`
  as the default content type.
  - The JSON format is preferred because it allows for the inclusion of
    additional metadata without introducing breaking changes.
  - The `YYYY-MM-DD` in the content type should correspond to the date
    representing the latest version of the API.
  - If the API does not return a JSON content type, the default content type
    **must** include versioned headers, such as
    `application/vnd.atlas.YYYY-MM-DD+csv`.

#### Examples

1. If an API supports both `application/vnd.atlas.YYYY-MM-DD+json` and
   `application/vnd.atlas.YYYY-MM-DD+csv`, the
   `application/vnd.atlas.YYYY-MM-DD+json` content type should be preferred and
   handled by the SDK.
2. If an API supports only `application/vnd.atlas.YYYY-MM-DD+json`, this content
   type should be preferred and handled by the SDK.

### Supporting Multiple Content Types

- SDKs and clients **may** offer the capability to request specific content
  types from the list of all supported response content types.
  - This feature enhances flexibility and allows clients to specify their
    preferred format.
