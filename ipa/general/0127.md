# IPA-127: Declarative-Friendly Interfaces

:::warning[State]

Adopt

:::

Following declarative-friendly standards is essential for ensuring **reliable**,
**consistent**, **automated**, and **low-latency integrations** with consumers,
such as **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools**, which many customers heavily
depend on for their DevOps workflows.\
An interface is considered "declarative-friendly" when resources can be managed
by specifying their **desired final state**, rather than outlining a series of
steps or actions. In this approach, a user defines **what** the resource should
look like via an IaC tool, while the tool and underlying API take care of the
**how**.

With the wide range of popular IaC tools and the constant demand to integrate
diverse resource types across multiple platforms, **uniformity** is critical to
fully automating these integrations.\

:::warning[Important]

In addition to the existing guidelines, **declarative-friendly** interfaces
require extra, stricter guidance to support IaC tooling automation.

:::

## Guidance

- A resource **must** be strongly consistent with the **Resource-Oriented
  Design** ([IPA-101](0101.md))
- A resource **must** have `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `GET`, `LIST` methods, except for
  [singleton resources](0113.md) and
  [read-only resources](0101.md#read-only-resources) which **must** have `GET`
  and `LIST` methods.
- A resource **should not** have custom methods ([IPA-109](0109.md)). Any
  complementary functionality of a resource exposed through custom methods will
  not be supported through automation. Deviation from this guidance requires a
  strong justification and review by the governing API body.

### Motivation and Strategic Goals

Our engineering teams and customers rely on IaC tools to manage infrastructure
repeatably and reliably. APIs that don't follow a declarative model require
complex and brittle integration work, creating a poor experience for all
consumers.

The primary strategic benefit of adopting a consistent declarative model is the
ability to **automate the generation of IaC provider resources**. When our APIs
are predictably declarative, we can build automations that create and maintain
tools such as our Terraform and CloudFormation providers. This will dramatically
accelerate the availability of IaC support for our products and reduce manual,
error-prone development.
