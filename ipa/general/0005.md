# IPA-5: Documenting Exceptions to IPAs

Following IPAs may not be possible for historical or technical reasons. For such
cases it is important to make all API producers and consumers aware when an IPA
can’t be followed to first avoid further adoption and second, capture the
reasoning and history for the offending APIs.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API producers **must** document within the OpenAPI spec when “should” or
  “must” guidance in an IPA is intentionally ignored to avoid unintentionally
  setting the wrong precedent for design
- API producers **must** document the exception at the appropriate level within
  the OpenAPI spec to align with the scope of the rule being enforced
  - For example:
    - If the rule applies to an operation, the extension **should** be added to
      the operation definition
  - OpenAPI spec components where exceptions can be defined include but not
    limited to:
    - Operation
    - Parameter
    - Schema
    - Response
    - Request Body

### Exception Format

- Exception rule names **must** start with `xgen-IPA-` prefix
- API producers **must** adhere to a key-value format.
  - Each key represents the IPA rule name, and the value provides the
    corresponding justification.
- API producers **must** provide an exception key that matches the rule name in
  the following format: `xgen-IPA-XXX-{rule-name}`
- API producers **must** provide a clear and concise explanation for why the
  exception is being applied
- API producer **may** define multiple exceptions at the same level if needed

Example

```json
{
  "x-xgen-IPA-exception": {
    "xgen-IPA-104-resource-has-GET": "Legacy API, not used by infrastructure-as-code tooling",
    "xgen-IPA-105-resource-has-LIST": "Legacy API, not used by infrastructure-as-code tooling"
  }
}
```

## Local Consistency

- If a set of functionality doesn’t adhere to an IPA, it can be confusing for
  new functionality to break the existing pattern for the sake of adhering to
  IPAs. API producers **should** prefer consistency and document the exception

## Pre-existing Functionality

- Features **may** be released before an IPA becomes standard, API producers
  **should** still document the exception
