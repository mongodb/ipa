# IPA-110: Pagination

APIs often need to provide collections of data, most commonly in the List
standard method. However, collections can often be arbitrarily sized and also
often grow over time, increasing lookup time as well as the size of the
responses being sent over the wire. Therefore, collections **must** be
paginated.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- APIs returning collections of data **must** provide pagination at the outset,
  as it is a backward-incompatible change to add pagination to an existing
  method
  - APIs **should** return collections within an `Paginated` prefixed envelop
    object
- The request **should** support an integer `itemsPerPage` query parameter
  allowing users to specify the maximum number of results to return
  - `itemsPerPage` **must not** be required
  - If the user does not specify `itemsPerPage` (or specifies 0)
    - The API **must not** return an error and chooses an appropriate default of
      100
  - If the user specifies itemsPerPage greater than the maximum permitted by the
    API
    - The API **should** coerce down to the maximum permitted page size
  - The API **may** return fewer results than the number requested (including
    zero results)
- The request **should** support an integer `pageNum` query parameter to allow
  the user to skip results
  - `pageNum` **must not** be required
  - If the user does not specify pageNum (or specifies 0)
    - The API **must not** return an error and chooses an appropriate default of
      1
    - The offset (skip) must be calculated as `(pageNum - 1) * itemsPerPage`
- The request **may** support a boolean `includeCount` query parameter to allow
  the user to omit the `totalCount` return value
  - `includeCount` **must not** be required
  - If the user does not specify `includeCount`
    - The API **must not** return an error and chooses an appropriate default of
      `true`
- The response for collections **must** define an array of `results` containing
  the paginated resource
- The response for collections **should** define an array of `links` field,
  providing the user with links to the next and previous pages
  - A next page link **must** only be included if thereâ€™s a next page available
    or if the service cannot determine if the end of the collection has been
    reached
  - A previous page link **must** be included if there's a previous page
    available
- The response for collections **may** provide an integer `totalCount` field,
  providing the user with the total number of resources available in the backing
  collection
  - This total **may** be an estimate, but the API **should** explicitly
    document that

Example

```http request
GET /groups/${groupId}/clusters[?pageNum=${pageNum}][&itemsPerPage=${itemsPerPage}][&includeCount=${includeCount}]
{
  "links": [...],
  "results": [...],
  "totalCount": 0
}
```

### Total count considerations

Historically APIs defaulted to `true` on `includeCount` but calculating the
total count for large collections can be computationally expensive.

- API producers **should** exercise caution when introducing support for
  `includeCount`
