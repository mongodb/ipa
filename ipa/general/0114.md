# IPA-114: Errors

Effective error communication is an important part of designing simple and
intuitive APIs. Services returning standardized error responses enable API
clients to construct centralized common error-handling logic. This common logic
simplifies API client applications and eliminates the need for cumbersome custom
error-handling code.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- APIs **must** return [`ApiError`](#api-error-format) when errors occur
- APIs **should** avoid unexpected errors (5XX) by correctly handling
  validations and exposing the appropriate error user error (4XX)
- Errors **must** use the canonical error codes allowed for the `errorCode`
  field
- APIs **should** make the best effort to validate as much as possible of the
  request and include all validation errors in the field `badRequestDetail`
  - `badRequestDetail` **must** include an array of fields and each field
    **must** include:
    - the error description as `description`
    - field with errors as `field`
- APIs **should** make the best effort to help customers with possible next
  steps in case of an error by adding the help field
  - `help` **must** include a short description as description
  - `help` **must** include a link to the documentation url
- [Methods](0103.md) **must** document any possible error and their associated
  [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

### Authentication and Authorization

- APIs **must** document `401 Unauthorized` and `403 Forbidden` status codes for
  endpoints that require authentication.
- APIs **must** return `401 Unauthorized` if the client lacks valid credentials.
- APIs **must** return `403 Forbidden` if the client is authenticated but does
  not have permission to access the resource.

### Not Found

- APIs **must** document the `404 Not Found` status code when the resource
  identifier includes one or more resource IDs.
- APIs **must** return a `404 Not Found` status code if the client provides an
  invalid or non-existent ID

> [!TIP] For path parameters consider applying regex-based routing to ensure
> invalid IDs are treated as `404 Not Found` rather than `400 Bad Request`.

### API Error Format

```json
{
  "error": 400, // HTTP status code (required)
  "reason": "Bad Request", // Human-readable error message (optional)
  "detail": "The request content produced validation errors.", // Detailed description (optional)
  "errorCode": "BAD_REQUEST", // Application-specific error code (optional)
  "parameters": [], // Array of additional parameters (optional)
  "badRequestDetail": {
    // Only present for validation errors (optional)
    "fields": [
      {
        "field": "Request body", // Path to the problematic field
        "description": "must not be null" // Description of the violation
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example

```json
{
  "badRequestDetail": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "description": "must not be null",
        "field": "groupId"
      },
      {
        "description": "must not be empty",
        "field": "authors[0].name"
      }
    ]
  },
  "detail": "The request content produced validation errors.",
  "error": 400,
  "errorCode": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "help": {
    "description": "troubleshooting documentation",
    "url": "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-errors/"
  },
  "parameters": [],
  "reason": "Bad Request"
}
```

> New fields `badRequestDetail` and `help` are inspired by
> [googleapis/google/rpc/error_details.proto](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/error_details.proto)
