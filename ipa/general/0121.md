# IPA-121: Datetime

Datetime can be confusing as timezones and calendars come into play. To help
clients understand how datetime is being used, its format should be uniform
across the API platform

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API producers must use
  [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8601:-1:ed-1:v1:en)
  datetime format in UTC for all time stamps
  - Documentation **must** note datetime format for clients
