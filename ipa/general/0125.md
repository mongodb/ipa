# IPA-125: Single Type in Request and Response

API requests and responses should strive for clarity by representing each field
with a single, well-defined type. This helps maintain consistency and reduces
ambiguity for API consumers. This convention also ensures that downstream
tooling is well-supported and prevents issues for IaC tools as it simplifies
state management.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- Splitting Fields for Multiple Value Types
  - API producers **should not** use oneOf with base types like int or string if
    the field can have multiple distinct value types
  - API producers **should** split such fields into separate, clearly named
    fields with appropriate types
- API producers **may** use fields that contain multiple objects when request
  and response objects allow explicitly setting the type of the object
  - In OpenAPI each `oneOf` property **must** be accompanied by a
    `discriminator` property defining when the exact type will be used
  - In OpenAPI each `discriminator` property **must** be accompanied by a 
        `oneOf`, `anyOf` or `allOf` property
  - If multiple `oneOf` models define a property with the same name, that property **must** have the type in each model

## Example

Avoid this design, using the same field for multiple types:

```http
POST /groups/search/index
{
  "indexArray": false, // Can be a boolean, an array or a single object
}
```

Preferred design, splitting the field into distinct types:

```http
POST /groups/search/index
{
  "isArray": false, //Explicitly a boolean
  "indexArrayObjects": [{<object1>}, {<object2>}], //Expilicitly an array
  "singleIndexObject": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"} //Explicitly a single object
}
```
