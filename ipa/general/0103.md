# IPA-103: Methods

An API is composed of one or more methods, which represent a specific operation
that a service can perform on behalf of the consumer.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API authors **should** choose from the defined categories in the following
  order:
  - Standard methods (on collections and resources)
  - Custom methods (on collections, resources, or stateless)
- Standard methods **must not** cause side effects
  - In such scenarios where a side effect is necessary, a custom method
    **should** be used
- Standard methods **must** guarantee
  [atomicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)>)
  - In cases where atomicity cannot be guaranteed, consider in the following
    order:
    - A new sub-resource with the appropriate methods
    - A [singleton-resource](0113.md) for the corresponding section
    - [Custom methods](0109.md), for example, an `Add` or `Remove` operation for
      repeated fields

If a standard method is unsuitable, then custom methods offer a lesser, but
still valuable level of consistency, helping the user reason about the scope of
the action and the object whose configuration is read to inform that action.

Selecting a custom method may be valuable for:

- State management of a resource since they usually carry side effects
- If atomic modifications are required when adding or removing from repeated
  fields

### Naming

- The method name is the
  [Operation ID](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/paths-and-operations/#operationid)
  (`operationId`) in the OpenAPI Specification
- Operation IDs **must** be unique
- Operation IDs **must** be in `camelCase`
