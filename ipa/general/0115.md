# IPA-115: Envelope Object

Some clients might not be able to access the HTTP response headers and/or status
code. In that case, clients can request that the response include an "envelope,"
which is simply an extra layer of information in the JSON document and contains
any relevant details that would normally be in the response headers.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- Resources **may** support a boolean `envelope` query parameter
- `envelope` **must** default to false
- If `envelope` is set to `true` for individual resources
  - The response **must** include the field `status` as the HTTP status code
  - The response **must** include the field `content` as the requested resource
- If `envelope` is set to `true` for [Paginated](0110.md) resources the existing
  response **must** include the field `status` as the HTTP status code

### Generated API Clients

- Generated clients **must not** support envelope
  - Conditionally changing the shape of a response is not supported by code
    generation tools
