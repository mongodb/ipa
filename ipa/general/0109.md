# IPA-109: Custom Methods

[Resource-oriented design](0101.md) uses custom methods to provide a means to
express arbitrary actions that are difficult to model using only the standard
methods.

## Guidance

- Custom methods **should** only be used for functionality that cannot be easily
  expressed via standard methods
  - Prefer standard methods if possible, due to their consistent semantics
- The name of the method **should** be a verb and **may** be followed by a noun
- The HTTP method **must** be `GET` or `POST`:
  - `GET` **must** be used for methods retrieving data or resource state.
  - `POST` **must** be used if the method has side effects or mutates resources
    or data
- Custom methods using the `GET` HTTP method **must** return a
  [200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)
  response.
- The HTTP URI **must** use a colon(:) character followed by the custom method
  name
  - This aims to clearly distinguish between custom methods and other resources
  - The custom method name **must** be written in `camelCase`
- See [Declarative-friendly resources](#declarative-friendly-resources) for
  further guidance

Example

```http request
POST /groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}:pause
GET /groups/${groupId}/clusters:search
POST /groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}:addNode
POST /groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}:removeNode
```

### Naming

- Operation ID **must** be unique
- Operation ID **must** be in `camelCase`
- Operation ID **must** start with the custom method verb
  - Derived from the path section delimited by the colon (:) character
- Operation ID **should** be followed by a noun or compound nouns
- The noun(s) in the Operation ID **should** be
  - The collection identifiers from the resource identifier in singular form
  - The custom method noun(s)
    - Derived from the path section delimited by the colon (:) character

| Resource Identifier                                  | Operation ID          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}:pause`   | `pauseGroupCluster`   |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}:addNode` | `addGroupClusterNode` |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters:search`                 | `searchGroupClusters` |

### Declarative-friendly resources

- Declarative-friendly resources **must not** use custom methods. To learn more,
  see [IPA-127](0127.md).
  - Custom methods require manual curation, implementation, and review for API
    tooling, which increases feature latency.
  - Declarative-friendly tools are unable to automatically determine what to do
    with them

:::tip

State transitions that carry side effects are usually good candidates for custom
methods
