# IPA-108: Delete

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `DELETE` request to a resource's URI
(for example, `/groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}`) to delete that
resource.

## Guidance

- APIs **should** provide a Delete method for resources unless it is not
  valuable for users to do so
- The HTTP verb **must** be
  [`DELETE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE)
- The response **should** be empty
  - Empty response **must** return
    [204 No Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204)
    status
- The request **must not** include a body
- The Delete method **should** succeed if and only if a resource was present and
  was successfully deleted
  - If the resource did not exist, the method **should** respond with a
    `NOT FOUND` [error](0114.md)

Example

```http request
DELETE /groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}
```

### Cascading Delete

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to be able to delete a resource as well
as all applicable child resources. However, since deletion is usually permanent,
it is also important that users not do so accidentally, as reconstructing
wiped-out child resources may be quite challenging.

If an API allows deletion of a resource that may have child resources, the API
**should** provide a `cascading=true` query parameter.

Example

```http request
DELETE /groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}?cascading=true
```

### Error Handling

See [IPA-114: Errors](0114.md) for guidance on error handling and documentation.

### Naming

- Operation ID **must** be unique
- Operation ID **must** be in `camelCase`
- Operation ID **must** start with the verb “delete”
- Operation ID **should** be followed by a noun or compound noun
- The noun(s) in the Operation ID **should** be the collection identifiers from
  the resource identifier in singular form

Examples:

| Resource Identifier                          | Operation ID         |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}` | `deleteGroupCluster` |
