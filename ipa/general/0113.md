# IPA-113: Singleton Resources

An API may define singleton resources. A singleton resource **must** always
exist by virtue of the existence of its parent, with one and exactly one per
parent.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- Singleton resources **must not** have a user-provided or system-generated ID
- Singleton resources **must not** define the [Create](0106.md) or
  [Delete](0108.md) standard methods
  - The singleton is implicitly created or deleted when its parent is created or
    deleted
- Singleton resources **should** define the [Get](0104.md) and [Update](0107.md)
  methods
- Singleton resources **may** define [custom methods](0109.md) as appropriate

Example

```http request
GET /groups/${groupId}/settings
###
PATCH /groups/${groupId}/settings
```
