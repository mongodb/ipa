# IPA-117: Documentation

Documentation serves as a primary tool for clients to better understand an API
and its functionality. Consistent documentation patterns across the API platform
will promote clarity, completeness and consistency.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

### Descriptions

- API producers **must** provide descriptions for:
  - Properties
  - Operations
  - Parameters
  - Tags
- Descriptions **should** be complete but brief
  - Descriptions **should** aim to cover
    - What it is
    - How to use it
    - Default values
    - Optional or required behavior
    - Common errors
  - Descriptions **should** avoid overly technical language
  - Descriptions **must** avoid company internal language conventions
  - Descriptions **should** prefer simple syntax that can easily be translated
    for non-English speakers
- See
  [Description Object](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/meta-data/description/)
- Documentation **may** link to external documentation when more in-depth
  information is pertinent
  - See
    [External Documentation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#external-documentation-object)

#### Formatting

- Description **may** use [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
- Descriptions **must** start with Uppercase and end with a full stop(.)
- Descriptions **must not** use raw HTML
- Descriptions **should not** include inline tables as this may not work well
  with all tools and in particular generated client code
  - Consider using lists over tables
  - Descriptions **may** contain CommonMark lists if the lists are short
  - If a comprehensive description with tables is needed, consider having a
    short description and using the `externalDocumentation`
- Descriptions **should not** include inline links
  - If the API producer needs to provide links to external documentation, they
    **should** use the `externalDocumentation`

### Examples

- API producers **must** provide a well-defined schema or example(s)
  - Tools can leverage schemas and field examples to generate request and
    response examples
  - For APIs where fields can be mutually exclusive, API producers **should**
    provide correct examples to consumers on how to use the API
  - For APIs that respond with plain text, for example, csv, API producers
    **must** provide an example
    - Some tools are not able to generate examples for such responses
- See [schema example](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#schemaExample)

### Default values

- API producers **must** document default values
  - See
    [Default Values](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/meta-data/default/)

### Validation Keywords

- API producers **must** detail the required/optional nature of the field and
  any conditions in both responses and requests
  - See
    [required fields](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/required/)
- For string values API producers **may** document:
  - [minLength](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/minlength/)
  - [maxLength](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/maxlength/)
  - [patterns](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/pattern/), for
    example `/^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*$/`
    - API producers **should** avoid overly specific patterns since changes to a
      pattern can be considered a breaking change
- For numeric values API producers **may** document
  - [minimum](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/minimum/),
  - [minimum (exclusive)](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/exclusiveminimum/)
  - [maximum](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/maximum/),
  - [maximum (exclusive)](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/exclusivemaximum/)
- For array fields API producers **may** document
  - [minItems](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/minitems/)
  - [maxItems](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/maxitems/)
- API producers **must not** combine unrelated validation keywords
- See [validations](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12/validation/) for a
  full list of available validations

### Operation Summary

- API Producers **must** use
  [Title Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case)
- Summaries **must not** end with a period
- Summaries **must not** use [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
- API Producers **must** use "One" when referring to a single item instead of
  "a" or "specified"
- "Remove" vs. "Delete"
  - API Producers **should** use "Delete" when the operation is destroying a
    resource e.g. "Delete One Identity Provider"
  - API Producers **should** use "Remove" when the resource itself isn't being
    destroyed, e.g. "Remove One MongoDB Cloud User from One Project"
- "Add" vs. "Create"
  - API Producers **should** use "Create" when the operation is creating a
    resource e.g. "Create One Identity Provider"
  - API Producers **should** use "Add" when the resource itself isn't being
    created, e.g. "Add One MongoDB Cloud User to One Project"
- API Producers **must not** use abbreviations and technical formatting
  - "Line Items" instead of "lineItems"
  - "Organization Configuration" instead of "Org Config"
  - "Feature Compatibility Version" instead of "FCV"
- API Producers **must** use "by" when referring to _how_ something should be
  queried
  - "Return One Event by ID" instead of "Return One Event Using Its ID"
- API Producers **should** avoid unnecessary filler words e.g. "possible",
  "available", "current"
- API Producers **must** use "Return" instead of "Get" or "List"
  - API Producers **must not** use "Return All" unless the API can really return
    _all_ items in a collection
    - Collections may contain an unbounded number of entries and must be
      paginated (see [Pagination](0110.md)). If the total number of entries can
      exceed the page size and prevent the client from accessing the full set,
      do not use "all."
- API Producers **must** use only one main action verb e.g. "Create," "Update,"
  "Delete," "Add," "Remove"
- API Producers **must** use "Update" instead of "Modify" or "Change"
- API Producers **must** use "in" for actions operating within the parent
  (retrieving, updating, creating) and "from" for removing/disassociating
  - "Remove One MongoDB Cloud User from One Project" instead of "Remove One
    MongoDB Cloud User in One Project"
  - "Update One MongoDB Cloud User in One Project" instead of "Update One
    MongoDB Cloud User from One Project"
