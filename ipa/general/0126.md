# IPA-126: Top-Level API Names

Top-level API names direct customers to the core services or functional areas
that service their needs. These names need to be intuitive, clear, and easily
recognizable to facilitate seamless navigation of API documentation.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API names **must** use ‘Title Case’
- API names **must** be written as nouns
  - **For example:** 'Alert Configurations' not 'Configure Alerts'
- API names **should** be precise and self-explanatory to convey the function of
  the APIs
- API names **should not** include platform-specific branding or terms
- APIs for platform services **should not** include the platform name
  - **For example,** 'Atlas Search' **should** be displayed as 'Search'
- Discoverability through search **should** be considered to facilitate fast
  identification
- API names **should** avoid using acronyms unless widely recognized

## OpenAPI Consideration

- When defining `tags` in OpenAPI Specification, these naming principles
  **should** be applied
- Each tag **should** represent a logical grouping of APIs, aligning with
  top-level service areas to enhance discoverability and navigation
