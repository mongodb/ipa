# IPA-119: Multi-Cloud Support by Default

Considering support for all cloud partners supported by Atlas, even if not
considered in the first iteration of an API, avoids associated API spec rework
and minimizes potential customer impact involved in versioning.

## Guidance

- API producers **should** default to multi-cloud support when implementing
  features
  - API producers **may** support only one cloud producer at implementation and
    note behavior in documentation
  - API producers **should** consider the API design in the context of all
    currently supported Atlas cloud partners, to avoid later rework
  - API producers **should** prefer vendor neutral terms
    - For example, blob storage over s3
  - When using a provider field or param API producers **should not** define a
    default value
    - As providers are added, having a default value can impact usability

Example

- Example multi-cloud object

```json
{
  "provider": "string", // allowed values AWS, AZURE, GCP
  "region": "string" // dependent on cloud provider selected
}
```
