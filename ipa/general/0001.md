# IPA-1 Improvement Proposal for APIs

IPA stands for Improvement Proposal for APIs, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. They are to
serve as the source of truth for API-related documentation at MongoDB and how
teams discuss and come to a consensus on API guidance.

The principles are not final and are subject to changes.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- IPAs **must** describe guidance on API design
- IPAs **should** provide instruction for API producers to help write APIs that
  are:
  - Simple
  - Intuitive
  - Consistent
- IPAs are linkable documents that reviewers can use as a source of truth in
  discussions

### Process

It is the goal for IPAs to be a collaborative effort within MongoDB; however,
the API experience team will:

- Be responsible for approving and curating IPAs
- Guaranteeing the correctness of the IPAs
- Managing the process by which IPAs are introduced, discussed, approved, or
  retired

At any point, any engineer **may** propose changes to existing IPAs or new IPAs.
To manage this process, IPAs will have a well-defined state.

### State

As technology progresses, and we discover new or better ways to do things, some
principles **may** evolve or be retired.

To facilitate discussions about how or when to use a principle, each one will be
labeled with a state described as:

#### Experimental

- New IPAs **must** start as experimental
- During this phase, API producers and API experience **should** collaborate to
  understand better:
  - Alignment with other IPAs
  - Technical implications and challenges, for example:
    - Versioning support
    - Adoption challenges
    - Testing plans
  - Possible proof of concepts
- The principle **may** be subject to change based on feedback
- API producers and API experience **may** decide if a principle is ready for
  adoption or instead be retired
  - IPAs that are retired during the experimental state are still valuable to
    keep to inform future decisions
- IPAs that stay in the experimental phase longer than a year from its initial
  proposal **must** transition to the retired phase
  - This allows keeping focus on the correct set of IPAs and avoids documenting
    principals that may no longer be worth considering
- Experimental **must** be documented using `WARNING` markdown alerts

Example:

```markdown
> [!WARNING]  
> **State:** Experimental
```

#### Adopt

The principle **must** be well-supported at the time of adoption, meaning that:

- It **must** provide a clear “how-to” to support implementation
- It **may** provide tooling support, where possible.
- API producers **must** follow this principle for new resources
- API producers **must** justify opting out
- Adopt **must** be documented using `NOTE` markdown alerts

Example:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt
```

#### Deprecated

- A newer/better way may have replaced the principle
- API producers **should** consider following principles in the “adopt” state
- API producers may be able to use the principle in cases where there **may**
  not be a replacement available
- Using deprecated principles for new resources is discouraged and considered
  opt-in
- API producers **must** justify its usage
- Deprecated **must** be documented using `WARNING` markdown alerts

Example:

```markdown
> [!WARNING]  
> **State:** Deprecated
```

#### Retired

- API producers **must** not use the principle for new resources or revisions
- Refactoring existing resources that now follow retired principles to migrate
  to a principle in the “adopt” state **may** be considered
- Retired principles are still useful to keep around
  - Historical reasons
  - Document how older APIs were designed and implemented
- Retired **must** be documented using `CAUTION` markdown alerts

Example:

```markdown
> [!CAUTION]  
> **State:** Retired
```
