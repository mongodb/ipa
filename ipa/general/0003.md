# IPA-3 IPA Style and Guidance

IPAs are most useful when they are clear and concise and cover a single topic or
inquiry well. In the same way that IPAs describe consistent patterns and style
for use in APIs, they also follow consistent patterns and style.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- IPAs **must** cover a single, discrete topic and provide clear, actionable
  guidance
- IPAs **must** not duplicate or contradict guidance in another IPA
- IPAs **may** also cover what not to do but **should not** cover only
  antipatterns

### IPA Structure

- IPAs **should** begin with an introduction (with no additional heading).
- IPAs **must** include the current state, formatted as
  [admonition](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions).
  - Valid states are listed in [IPA-1](0001.md)
- The guidance section **may** include subsections that elaborate further on the
  details
- If necessary, the IPA **may** include a “Further Reading” section after
  guidance

### Requirement Keywords

- IPAs **should** use the following requirement level keywords: "**MUST**",
  "**MUST NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", and "**MAY**", which are to be
  interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
- When using these terms in IPAs, they **must** be lower-case and bold
- These terms **should not** be used in other ways
