# IPA-123: Enums

By leveraging enumerations (enums) whenever a field only accepts a discrete set
of values and documenting those values we can easily communicate to customers
the expectation for that data field.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API producers **should** use enumeration objects for sets of values for a
  field that are expected to remain relatively static
  - API producers **may** include additional documentation to include an
    explanation for each of the allowable fields
- Enumeration values **must** be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- API producers **should** default to having enums extensible to freely add more
  values
  - Enums **must not** be extended in a non-compatible fashion. I.e. splitting
    one enum value into two
- API producers **should** use a string field if allowable enum values change
  often or exceed **20**
  - If so, API producers **must** document the allowable values.

Example:

- Stable Enum (small, rarely changes)

```yaml
type: string
title: Alert Audit Types
description: Type of alert audit action.
enum:
  - ALERT_ACKNOWLEDGED_AUDIT
  - ALERT_UNACKNOWLEDGED_AUDIT
```

- Dynamic or Large Enum Set (changing often or > 20 values)

```yaml
type: string
title: Alert Audit Type
description: >
  String identifying the type of alert audit action. The list of allowed values
  changes frequently or is extensive (>20). Refer to the API documentation for
  the current list of allowed values.
example: ALERT_ACKNOWLEDGED_AUDIT
