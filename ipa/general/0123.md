# IPA-123: Enums

By leveraging enumerations (enums) whenever a field only accepts a discrete set
of values and documenting those values we can easily communicate to customers
the expectation for that data field.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API producers **should** use enumeration objects for sets of values for a
  field that are expected to remain relatively static
  - API producers **may** include additional documentation to include an
    explanation for each of the allowable fields
- Enumeration values **must** be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- API producers **should** default to having enums extensible to freely add more
  values
  - Enums **must not** be extended in a non-compatible fashion. I.e. splitting
    one enum value into two
- API producers **should** opt for a string when allowable enum values exceed 20
