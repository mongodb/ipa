# IPA-102: Resource Identifiers

Most APIs expose resources (their primary nouns) that users can create,
retrieve, and manipulate. Additionally, resources are named meaning each
resource has a unique identifier that API consumers use to reference that
resource.

## Guidance

- The full resource identifier is a URI without transport protocols (schemeless)
  - Fully qualified paths
- All resource identifiers defined by an API **must** be unique
  - Resource names are formatted according to the
    [URI path schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#appendix-A)
- Resource identifiers **must** use the slash (/) character to separate
  individual segments of the resource identifier
  - Double slashes (//) **must not** be used
- Resource identifier components **should** alternate between:
  - Collection identifiers (example: groups, clusters, orgs, users)
    - Collection identifiers **must** be in `camelCase`
    - Collection identifiers **must** begin with a lowercase letter and contain
      only ASCII letters and numbers (`/[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*/`).
    - Collection identifiers **must** be plural
      - In situations where there is no plural word ("info"), or where the
        singular and plural terms are the same ("moose"), the non-pluralized
        (singular) form is correct.
  - Resource IDs (example: `groupId`, `clusterName`, `orgId`)
- Resource identifiers **should not** use abbreviations
  - Unless the abbreviation is well understood, for example, IP, AWS, TCP
- Resource identifier **must not** include file extensions such as `.gz`,`.csv`,
  `.json`
  - The file extension **must** be only included as
    [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types)
    in the
    [Accept Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept).
  - Examples:
    - `Accept: application/zip`
    - `Accept: application/json`
    - `Accept: application/xml`
    - `Accept: application/gzip`

Example

- Group identifier `/groups/{groupId}`
- Cluster identifier `/groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}`
- User collection identifier `/orgs/{orgId}/users`

### Nested Collections

If a resource identifier contains multiple levels of a hierarchy and a parent
collection's name is used as a prefix for the child resource's name, the child
collection's name **may** omit the prefix.

:::note

Relationships between resources expressed as nested collections or hierarchical
relationships have certain implications that API producers need to consider

:::

- Nested collections imply a cascade effect
- Deleting a parent **must** delete associated children
- Access to the parent **may** imply access to children
- Children **must not** belong to multiple parents
