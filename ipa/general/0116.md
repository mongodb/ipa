# IPA-116: Backwards Compatibility

APIs are fundamentally contracts with users, and users often write code against
APIs that are then launched into a production service with the expectation that
it continues to work. Therefore, it is important to understand what constitutes
a backward-compatible change and what constitutes a backward-incompatible
change.

## Guidance

- Existing client code written against a revision **must not** be broken by
  minor changes to the service
- API producers **must** consider syntax breaking changes
- API producers **must** consider semantic breaking changes
- API producers **must** not break backwards compatibility with a change without
  issuing a new API version
- API producers **should** leverage extensible design where applicable
- New functionality **may** be added to existing versions, granted there are no
  incompatibilities introduced

### Syntax Breaking Changes

Changes considered breaking include:

- New required fields **must not** be added to an existing version of an API
- Optional fields **must not** be removed from the request or response of an
  existing version of an API version
- Existing API components **must not** be renamed or removed from an existing
  version of an API
- Default values provided for a field **must not** change
- Changes to path, query request headers or body content **must not** be made
- Field names **must not** change or be removed
- Field types **must not** be changed
- Status codes **must not** change
- Operation Ids **must not** be updated or deleted
- Operation Tags **must not** be updated or deleted
- HTTP Verbs **must not** be changed or deleted
- Media type **must not** be changed or deleted
- Existing resources **must not** be moved to a new URI
- Existing resources **must not** be removed without previously being marked as
  sunsetting
- Existing options within enum fields **must not** be changed or removed

Changes considered non-breaking include:

- New output fields **may** be added to existing versions
- Optional input parameters **may** be added to existing versions
- Updates/Changes to underlying logic that results in different results  
  WITHOUT affecting the shape of the response **may** be added to existing
  versions
- Changes to unstructured human-readable string values **may**  
  be added to existing versions (Exceptions for machine codes or formatted
  strings i.e., dates)
- Response headers **may** be added to existing versions
- Changes to a resources authorization **may** be added to existing versions
- New options **may** be added to existing enums

### Semantic Breaking Changes

Semantic-based breaking changes capture situations in which behavior of a
resource is changing without necessarily including a syntax-based breaking
change that would produce a top-level error. These situations often require
intensive data analysis and discovery to fully understand the extent of customer
impact for the change.
