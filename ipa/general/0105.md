# IPA-105: List

In many APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a collection's URI (for
example, `/groups/{groupId}/clusters`) to retrieve a list of resources, each of
which lives within that collection.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- APIs **must** provide a List method for resources unless the resource is a
  singleton
  - The purpose of the List method is to return data from a finite collection
- The HTTP verb **must** be
  [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET)
- The method **must not** [cause side effects](0103.md)
- The request **must not** include a body
- The response body **should** consist of the same resource object returned by
  the [Get](0104.md) method
  - The object **may** include any
    [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) `links` field from the
    individual resource
- The response status code **must** be
  [200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)

Example

```http request
GET /groups/${groupId}/clusters
```

### Naming

- Operation ID **must** be unique
- Operation ID **must** be in `camelCase`
- Operation ID **must** start with the verb “list”
- Operation ID **should** be followed by a noun or compound noun
- The noun(s) in the Operation ID **should** be the collection identifiers from
  the resource identifier in singular form, where the last noun is in plural
  form

Examples:

| Resource Identifier           | Operation ID        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters` | `listGroupClusters` |
