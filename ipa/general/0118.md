# IPA-118: Extensible by Default

Signaling to clients any intentions for future extensibility and designing APIs
conservatively reduces the potential of unintended impact.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API specs **must not** set
  [additionalProperties](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object#additionalproperties)
  to `false` to flag to clients that additional fields **may** be added
- Request parameter data constraints **should** be specific and restrictive to
  provide freedom for extensions
- API producers **should** default to multi-cloud support when implementing
  features
