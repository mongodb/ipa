# IPA-2 IPA Numbering

The IPA system provides a mechanism to index and has a single source of truth
for Improvement Proposals for APIs.

All IPAs have an associated number to make them easier to reference, and editors
are expected to assign a number to their proposals.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Assigning IPA Numbers

While IPA numbering is arbitrary, authors can choose to suggest assigning
related IPAs to a  
specific block of numbers for better organization and reference.

## IPA Blocks

Currently, recognized blocks of IPA numbers are:

- 1-99: Reserved for meta-IPAs
- 100-899: General API design guidance
- 900-999: SDK and client integrations guidance

API producers **may** request dedicated blocks for domain-specific IPAs
