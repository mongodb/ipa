# IPA-100: Language

Developers worldwide use MongoDB, and many customers who don't speak English as
their first language consume our APIs. It is important to avoid any possible
confusion across different idioms and colloquialisms unifying to a common
language.

## Guidance

API producers **must** use American English across the API.

This includes but is not limited to:

- Resource names
- Field names
- Descriptions
- Enum values

**Example:** “canceled” over
[cancelled](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Cloud-Backups/operation/createBackupExportJob).
