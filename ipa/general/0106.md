# IPA-106: Create

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `POST` request to a collection's URI
(for example, `/groups/{groupId}/clusters`) to create a new resource within that
collection.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- APIs **should** provide a create method for resources unless it is not
  valuable for users to do so
  - The purpose of the create method is to create a new resource in a collection
- The HTTP verb **must** be
  [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST)
- The resource **must** be the request body
  - API producers **should** implement as a `Request` suffixed object
    - A `Request` object **must** include only input fields
      - In OpenAPI, this means that the `Request` object **must not** include
        fields with `readOnly: true`
- The response body **should** be the same resource returned by the
  [Get](0104.md) method
- Create operations **must not** accept query parameters
  - Query parameters are usually a sign of a side effect that standard methods
    **must not** cause
- The response status code **must** be
  [201 Created](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201)

Example

```http request
POST /groups/${groupId}/clusters
```

### Error Handling

See [IPA-114: Errors](0114.md) for guidance on error handling and documentation.

### Naming

- Operation ID **must** be unique
- Operation ID **must** be in `camelCase`
- Operation ID **must** start with the verb “create”
- Operation ID **should** be followed by a noun or compound noun
- The noun(s) in the Operation ID **should** be the collection identifiers from
  the resource identifier in singular form

Examples:

| Resource Identifier           | Operation ID         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters` | `createGroupCluster` |
