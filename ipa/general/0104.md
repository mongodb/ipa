# IPA-104: Get

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a resource's URI (for
example, `/groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}`) to retrieve that resource.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- APIs **must** provide a Get method for resources
- The purpose of the Get method is to return data from a single resource
- The HTTP verb **must** be
  [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET)
- The method **must not** [cause side effects](0103.md)
- The request **must not** include a body
- API producers **should** implement as a `Response` suffixed object
  - A `Response` object **must not** include fields available only on creation
    or update
    - In OpenAPI, this means that the `Response` object **must not** include
      fields with `writeOnly: true`
- The response status code **must** be
  [200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)
- The response **may** include a
  [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) `links` field

Example

```http request
GET /groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}
```

### Naming

- Operation ID **must** be unique
- Operation ID **must** be in `camelCase`
- Operation ID **must** start with the verb “get”
- Operation ID **should** be followed by a noun or compound noun
  - The noun(s) in the Operation ID **should** be the collection identifiers
    from the resource identifier in singular form
    - If the resource is a [singleton](0113.md), the last noun **may** be the
      plural form of the collection identifier

Examples:

| Resource Identifier                          | Operation ID       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}` | `getGroupCluster`  |
| (Singleton) `/groups/${groupId}/settings`    | `getGroupSettings` |

### Error Handling

See [IPA-114: Errors](0114.md) for guidance on error handling and documentation,
in particular Authentication, Authorization and Not Found.
