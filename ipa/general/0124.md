# IPA-124: Repeated Fields

Providing clients with lists of data can be complex. Aligning on a single
strategy for providing clients with repeated fields allows the complexity to be
reduced when clients need to modify the lists.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- Repeated fields **must** use a plural field name
- Repeated fields **should** have an enforced upper bound that will not cause a
  single resource payload to become too large
  - A good rule of thumb is 100 elements
  - If repeated data has the chance of being too large, the API **should** use a
    sub-resource instead

## Update Strategy

- A resource **may** use one of two strategies to enable updating a repeated
  field:
  - Direct update using the standard [Update](0107.md) method
    - A standard `Update` method is only able to update the entire list
  - Custom `Add` and `Remove` methods
    - When choosing a [custom method](0109.md) approach, API consumers **must
      not** be able to set the field via [Create](0106.md) or [Update](0107.md)
      operations

> [!NOTE]  
> Declarative-friendly resources **must** use the standard [Update](0107.md)
> method, and not introduce `Add` and `Remove` methods. To learn more, see
> [IPA-127](0127.md).
