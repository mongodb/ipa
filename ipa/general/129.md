# IPA-129: Filtering

When designing [List Methods](0105.md), API producers may want to employ the use
of filtering. When the number of items in a collection is large, filtering can
help clients retrieve only the items they are interested in.

> [!WARNING]  
> **State:** Experimental

## Guidance

- API producers **may** implement filtering on [List Methods](0105.md)
- API producers **must not** implement filtering on [Create Methods](0106.md) or
  [Update Methods](0107.md)
- API producers **may** introduce new filtering options for existing APIs
  - API producers **must not** remove or modify existing filtering options, see
    [IPA-116: Backwards Compatibility](0116.md)

### Query Parameters

- Filtering **should** be implemented using query parameters
  - For example, `/groups?name=example`
- API producers **should** consider the possible maximum length of the API
  request URI
  - Some browsers and servers may have limits for URI lengths
  - The maximum possible length of the URI **must not** exceed 2048 characters
    when all possible query parameters are combined
- The number of query parameters for an API **must not** exceed 20
  - A high number of query parameters may lead to complexities in the filtering
    logic as well as performance issues
