# IPA-107: Update

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `PATCH` or `PUT` request to a resource's
URI (for example, `/groups/{groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}`) to update that
resource.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- APIs **should** provide an update method for resources unless it is not
  valuable for users to do so
  - The purpose of the Update method is to make changes to the resources without
    causing side effects
- The HTTP verb **should** be
  [`PATCH`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH) and
  support partial resource update
  - The HTTP verb **may** be
    [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT) If
    the method will only ever support full resource replacement
  - `PUT` is strongly discouraged because it becomes a backward-incompatible
    change to add fields to the resource
- The request body **must** contain the resource being updated, i.e. the
  resource or parts of the resource returned by the [Get method](0104.md)
  - API producers **should** implement as a `UpdateRequest` suffixed object
    - A `UpdateRequest` object **must** include only input fields
      - In OpenAPI, this means that the `UpdateRequest` object **must not**
        include fields with `readOnly: true`
- The response body **should** be the same resource returned by the
  [Get method](0104.md)
  - The Update method should return the complete resource to avoid complexities
    for clients
- Update operations **must not** accept query parameters
  - Query parameters are usually a sign of a side effect that standard methods
    **must not** cause
- The response status code **should** be
  [`200 OK`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)
- Resources **should** provide a single canonical update operation
  - If a resource has multiple Update methods, it's possible one, or all of
    them, **may** be [custom methods](0109.md)

Example

```http request
PATCH /groups/${groupId}/clusters/{clusterName}
```

### Error Handling

See [IPA-114: Errors](0114.md) for guidance on error handling and documentation.

### Naming

- Operation ID **must** be unique
- Operation ID **must** be in `camelCase`
- Operation ID **must** start with the verb “update”
- Operation ID **should** be followed by a noun or compound noun
- The noun(s) in the Operation ID **should** be the collection identifiers from
  the resource identifier in singular form
  - If the resource is a [singleton resource](0113.md), the last noun **may** be
    the plural form of the collection identifier

Examples:

| Resource Identifier                          | Operation ID          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `/groups/${groupId}/clusters/${clusterName}` | `updateGroupCluster`  |
| (Singleton) `/groups/${groupId}/settings`    | `updateGroupSettings` |
