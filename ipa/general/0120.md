# IPA-120: Versioning

API producers should avoid incrementing the API version where possible,
prioritizing supporting the current API version unless absolutely necessary.
This philosophy reduces exposing our clients to the friction of migrating
versions and multiple versions complicates maintenance, testing and
documentation for MongoDB.

> [!NOTE]  
> **State:** Adopt

## Guidance

- API producers **should** consider whether their changes warrant a new version
  or can be made backward compatible
  - API producers **should** refer to backwards compatibility
    ([IPA-116](0116.md)) prior to versioning their API
  - API producers **should not** version their API if the desired functionality
    can be achieved in a backwards compatible fashion
  - API producers **should** consider whether introducing a new endpoint
    alongside existing, in lieu of a new version
  - API producers **should** avoid versioning an API solely to rename existing
    fields or paths
- API producers **may** coordinate to sunset old versions faster than the
  default timeline of one-year
- API producers **must** coordinate with clients to transition to new versions
  to avoid impact
