# IPA-112: Field Names

Naming fields in a way that is intuitive to users can often be one of the most
challenging aspects of designing an API. This is true for many reasons; often a
field name that seems entirely intuitive to the author can baffle a reader.

Users rarely use only one API; they use many APIs together. As a result, a
single company using the same name to mean different things (or different names
to mean the same thing) can often cause unnecessary confusion.

It's important to keep consistency to allow users take what they've already
learned from one API and apply that to another.

In short, APIs are easiest to understand when field names are simple, intuitive,
and consistent with one another.

## Guidance

- Field names **should** communicate the concept being presented and avoid
  ambiguous names
  - Field names **should** avoid including unnecessary words
- Field names **must** use `camelCase`
- Fields **must not** contain leading, trailing, or adjacent underscores(\_)
  - `id` not `_id`
- Field names **should not** use abbreviations
  - Unless the abbreviation is well understood, for example, IP, AWS, TCP
- APIs **should** aim to use the same name for the same concept and different
  names for different concepts wherever possible
  - Including across APIs and resources
  - Names **should** follow/be unified between GUI and API
- Repeated fields **must** use the proper plural form
- Field names **must** not be named to reflect an intent or action
  - Fields **must not** be verbs
  - `disabled` not `disable`
- Boolean fields **should** omit the prefix "is"
  - `disabled` not `isDisabled`
- Field names of common conventions **must** use the same field name and
  description as existing fields
- Field names **must** refer to a singular concept when used across APIs
- Existing concepts **must** map to a singular field name
- For enum fields the allowable values **may** differ from values allowed in
  other instances of the field

## Group vs. Project

- For consistency APIs **must** use "group," "groups," "groupId" over "project,"
  "projects" or "projectId"
