# IPA-101: Resource-Oriented Design

Resource-oriented design is a pattern for specifying APIs based on several
high-level design principles:

- The fundamental building blocks of an API are
  [individually named resources](0102.md) (nouns) and the relationships and
  hierarchy that exist between them
- A small number of [standard methods](0103.md) (verbs) provide the semantics
  for most common operations
  - [Custom methods](0109.md) are available in situations where the standard
    methods do not fit.
- Stateless protocol: Each interaction between the client and the server are
  independent, and both the client and server have clear roles

> [!NOTE]

## Guidance

When designing an API, consider the following (roughly in logical order):

- The resources (nouns) the API will provide
- The relationships and hierarchies between those resources
- The schema of each resource
- The methods (verbs) each resource provides rely as much as possible on the
  [standard verbs](0103.md)

### Resources

- A resource-oriented API **should** generally be modeled as a resource
  hierarchy
  - Each node is either a simple resource or a collection of resources
  - A collection contains resources of the same type
  - A resource usually has fields
- Resources **may** have any number of sub-resources
- The schema for a resource **must** be the same across all methods related to
  the resource

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> API producers **should not** expect that their API will be reflective of their
> database schema. Having an API that is identical to the underlying database
> schema is an antipattern, as it tightly couples the surface to the underlying
> system

### Methods

A typical resource-oriented API exposes a large number of resources with a small
number of methods on each resource and **should not** be confused with the HTTP
methods. The methods here described related to the operations available on a
resource.

The methods can be:

- The standard methods ([Get](0104.md), [List](0105.md), [Create](0106.md),
  [Update](0107.md), [Delete](0108.md))
- [Custom methods](0109.md)

The following table illustrates the relationship between resources and the
standard methods:

| Standard method | Request                                        | Response                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Create          | Contains the future resource                   | Is the resource         |
| Get             | None                                           | Is the resource         |
| Update          | Contains the resource or parts of the resource | Is the current resource |
| Delete          | None                                           | None                    |
| List            | None                                           | Are the resources       |

- A resource **must** support at minimum [Get](0104.md)
  - Clients **must** be able to validate the state of resources after performing
    a mutation such as [Create](0106.md), [Update](0107.md), or
    [Delete](0108.md)
- A resource **must** also support [List](0105.md) except for
  [singleton resources](0113.md) where more than one resource is not possible
- APIs **should** prefer standard methods over custom methods
  - [Custom methods](0109.md) help define functionality that does not cleanly
    map to any of the standard methods

### Readonly Resources

- Unsupported operations on readonly resources **should** return
  `405 Not Allowed`
- Unsupported operations **must not** be documented
  - Some declarative-friendly clients require all standard methods to be
    implemented, but we consider documented unsupported methods to be in
    detriment of generated documentation and code
