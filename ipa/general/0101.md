# IPA-101: Resource-Oriented Design

Resource-oriented design is a pattern for specifying APIs based on several
high-level design principles:

- The fundamental building blocks of an API are
  [individually named resources](0102.md) (nouns) and the relationships and
  hierarchy that exist between them
- A small number of [standard methods](0103.md) (verbs) provide the semantics
  for most common operations
  - [Custom methods](0109.md) are available in situations where the standard
    methods do not fit.
- Stateless protocol: Each interaction between the client and the server are
  independent, and both the client and server have clear roles

## Guidance

When designing an API, consider the following (roughly in logical order):

- The resources (nouns) the API will provide
- The relationships and hierarchies between those resources
- The schema of each resource
- The methods (verbs) each resource provides rely as much as possible on the
  [standard verbs](0103.md)

### Resources

- A resource-oriented API **should** generally be modeled as a resource
  hierarchy
  - Each node is either a simple resource or a collection of resources
  - A collection contains resources of the same type
  - A resource usually has fields
- Resources **may** have any number of sub-resources
- The schema for a resource **must** be the same across all methods related to
  the resource

:::warning[Important]

API producers **should not** expect that their API will be reflective of their
database schema. Having an API that is identical to the underlying database
schema is an antipattern, as it tightly couples the surface to the underlying
system

### Methods

A typical resource-oriented API exposes a large number of resources with a small
number of methods on each resource and **should not** be confused with the HTTP
methods. The methods here described related to the operations available on a
resource.

The methods can be:

- The standard methods ([Get](0104.md), [List](0105.md), [Create](0106.md),
  [Update](0107.md), [Delete](0108.md))
- [Custom methods](0109.md)

The following table illustrates the relationship between resources and the
standard methods:

| Standard method | Request                                        | Response                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Create          | Contains the future resource                   | Is the resource         |
| Get             | None                                           | Is the resource         |
| Update          | Contains the resource or parts of the resource | Is the current resource |
| Delete          | None                                           | None                    |
| List            | None                                           | Are the resources       |

- A resource **must** support at minimum [Get](0104.md)
  - Clients **must** be able to validate the state of resources after performing
    a mutation such as [Create](0106.md), [Update](0107.md), or
    [Delete](0108.md)
- A resource **must** also support [List](0105.md) except for
  [singleton resources](0113.md) where more than one resource is not possible
- APIs **should** prefer standard methods over custom methods
  - [Custom methods](0109.md) help define functionality that does not cleanly
    map to any of the standard methods

### Read-Only Resources

Read-only resources are resources that cannot be modified by API consumers.

- Read-only resources **must** have [Get](0104.md) and [List](0105.md) methods
- Read-only resources **must not** have [Create](0106.md), [Update](0107.md), or
  [Delete](0108.md) methods
- Read-only resources **may** have [custom methods](0109.md) as appropriate
- All response schema properties for read-only resources **must** be marked as
  read-only
  - In OpenAPI, this means all properties **must** have `readOnly: true`
  - All fields in read-only resources are server-owned. For guidance on
    server-owned fields, see [IPA-111](0111.md#single-owner-fields)
- Unsupported operations on read-only resources **should** return
  `405 Not Allowed`
- Unsupported operations **must not** be documented
  - Some declarative-friendly clients require all standard methods to be
    implemented, but we consider documented unsupported methods to be in
    detriment of generated documentation and code
